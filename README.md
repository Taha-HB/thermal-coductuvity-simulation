 # Thermal Conductivity Simulation

## Project Overview
This project presents a numerical simulation of heat transfer through
different materials. It demonstrates how thermal conductivity affects
the temperature distribution of a material over time using the heat
equation.

The simulation is implemented in both Python and MATLAB for educational
and comparative purposes.

## Key Concepts
- Heat Transfer
- Thermal Conductivity
- Heat Equation
- Thermodynamics
- Numerical Simulation (Finite Difference Method)

---

## Materials Studied
- Copper
- Aluminum
- Steel
- Wood

Each material has a different thermal conductivity, which directly
affects the rate of heat flow.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- **MATLAB / MATLAB Online**

## How the Simulation Works
A one-dimensional rod is considered. One end of the rod is maintained at
a high temperature, while heat is allowed to diffuse through the rod
over time.

The governing equation is:

∂T/∂t = α ∂²T/∂x²

where:
- T is temperature
- t is time
- x is position
- α is thermal diffusivity of the material
